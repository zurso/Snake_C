/*
Snake Game C implementation
Authors: Jacob Pawlak, Zachary Urso
This project was laid out and designed from a basic format. Using an agile approach to tackle small tasks for the larger result
we were able to divide and conquer the tasks at hand into several for each developer.
Below you will be able to go through the code and see the functions in which we both implemented. Most were written together, 
but added names to those of major progess to completion.

This is our main: here we are able to do many preparations before we start the code, as well as where we can handle diretional
changes in a loop that is infinite until an alarm is handled by user quitting, error, or by a game rule.
We set the seed for the random number generator using the srand and time functions, and then set the timer and the signal handler
initializing curses is a curial part of the program, and we handle if there is an error.  We then set noecho() so commands will
not be echoed out to the screen. We initialize our window (mainwin) and set keypad to TRUE. Another important part is grabbing
the current settings before we change anything for good, this is boolean 0-1 (1 for setting back to old). We then enter the game
by choosing a direction, creating the snake (intializing and allocating memory, and then draw the first part to the screen).
Our while llook then runs which is dependent on arrow key switching and keys being hit to quit.

Here is where we define the randomness for the start direction. I simply chose a random number from 1-4, based off that number from
the rng we are able to provide a case statement for each one, i think it is cleaner than using if statements, therefor we used case
for direction. I defined UP DOWN LEFT RIGHT as globals so when we move elsewhere at other times then the names are clear to see
instead of using 1-4
